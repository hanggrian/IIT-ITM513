    "> 2. **(SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION WITH AVERAGE YEARNLY NYC TEMPERATURES TIME SERIES)** Go to [NOAA's Climate at a Glance page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag) and download the available time series data for the New York City average *annual* temperatures from 1895 through present (1895-2017 at the time of this writing). For your convenience, we provided the data in the file `ave_yearly_temp_nyc_1895-2017.csv`. Reimplement the simple linear regression case study of **Section 1** using the average yearly temperature data. How does the temperature trend compare to the average January high temperatures?\n",
