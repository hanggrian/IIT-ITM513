# Machine learning essay

Machine learning (ML) is a sub-category of artificial intelligence (AI) studying
statistical models that empower computers to self-learn and improve from
experience. Instead of needing specific instructions, machine learning analyzes
massive datasets to find patterns and decide accordingly. Over time, they keep
improving through trial and error, allowing them to uncover complex insights,
automate tasks, and make accurate predictions.

## Supervised learning

In supervised learning, algorithms are trained using data that has already been
labeled or categorized (Google, n.d.). Each information (feature) has a
corresponding correct answer (label). With enough training of these information
pairs, algorithms can predict the desired output for new, unseen data.

1.  **Classification:** Classification: Sort data into categories by comparing
    input features and anticipating labels, like "spam" or "important". They are
    typically used when dealing with data that fall into distinctive groups.
1.  **Regression:** Monitor continuous values by examining relationships between
    variables. For instance, factors like house size and location can be
    analyzed to predict future prices.

## Unsupervised learning

Unlike supervised learning which relies on pre-defined labels, unsupervised
learning lets AI models find hidden patterns in unlabeled information
(Google, n.d.). They are given raw data with no categories to uncover structures
independently. Unsupervised learning is ideal for detecting anomalies and
revealing fraudulent activity.

1.  **Clustering:** Sort uncategorized data into groups predicated on their
    similarities. One of the most popular techniques used in customer
    segmentation and image analysis.
    - **Exclusive clustering:** Assigns each data point to a pre-defined number
      of clusters.
    - **Overlapping clustering:** Data points belong to multiple clusters with
      some level of ownership.
    - **Hierarchical clustering:** Constructs a hierarchy of clusters by
      constantly reorganizing data based on their similarities.
    - **Probabilistic clustering:** Allocate data points to clusters depending
      on the likelihood of them belonging to each category.
1.  **Association:** Applies the "if-then" rules to uncover matching
    descriptions within datasets. Recommending products customers often buy
    together is one common application of this technique.
1.  **Dimensionality reduction:** Determines which data features are relevant to
    extract. The output is a simplified version that can improve data
    visualization.

## Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning uses a reward-and-punishment system to encourage
computers to make decisions toward optimal results (Amazon, n.d.). This strategy
resembles a human trial-and-error learning process where short-term sacrifices
are made for long-term benefits. The reinforcement learning approach is suitable
for uncertain scenarios in a complex environment.

1.  **Model-based:** Builds a virtual representation of the surrounding
    environment through trial and error. For example, a robot learning to
    navigate a building first explores to build a map and then simulates
    different paths to optimize navigation.
1.  **Model-free:** Agent learns by directly interacting with the environment,
    such as self-driving vehicle driving through city traffic.  This approach is
    useful when building a model is impossible or impractical.
