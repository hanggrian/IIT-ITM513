# Learning report

## Summary

With no prior knowledge or experience in machine learning or artificial
intelligence, I began my homework by gathering as much information online from
reputable sources. This process led to articles by *Google Cloud* and *Amazon
Web Services* regarding different machine learning types and techniques. I then
compose an essay based on information scrapped from the editorial content.

The second part of the homework delves into data visualization using Matplotlib,
a powerful library for creating interactive visualizations. The first sub-task
is obtaining information externally using the [SciKit learning tool](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
and then displaying the result in pair plots. Lastly, a scatter plot of New York
City temperature historical data is presented in a scatter plot. A linear
regression model is trained to predict a temperature given the current
environment.

## Question 1

> Did you successfully get your assignment done? Did it run? Any error? Did you
  get the correct result? Did you test your program thoroughly?

I have finished the assignment. Admittedly, I have done only a handful of tests
before submission.

## Question 2

> How much time did you spend to complete your assignment?

It took me several hours to research machine learning. A full day of work is
required to write the essay and complete the source code.

## Question 3

> Did you find the assignment easy or challenging for you?

The assignment is moderate in difficulty. Granted, it is challenging because I
am inexperienced in machine learning. On the other hand, the SciKit package is
extensive for training basic models and even provides relevant data samples.

## Question 4

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I received no help and wrote the program independently.

## Question 5

> When you encountered obstacles to complete your program, how did you resolve
  the issues? Did you use Google to get help? Describe how Google was abled or
  not able to assist you?

Over time, programming communities have accumulated information and
trial-and-errors in forum-based websites like StackOverflow. They act as a
knowledge base to self-educate and troubleshoot errors.

## Question 6

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

I learned the basics of artificial intelligence by reading educational blogs and
hands-on experience with the SciKit tool.

## Question 7

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor? Make sure
  you provide program output on each option.

Artificial intelligence is a popular topic nowadays, some say it has contributed
to the rapid adoption of Python programming. I am excited to learn machine
learning on this premise.
