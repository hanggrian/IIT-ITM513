# Learning report

## Question 1

> Did you complete your assignment and did your program run without errors?

I completed the assignment and my program ran without errors as tested in
PyCharm and Terminal.

## Question 2

> Did your program produce the correct result?

I believe my solution is correct and considers edge cases.

## Question 3

> Did you test your program thoroughly?

I tested my program with limited sample data in the unit test. In the case of
`r2d` and `d2r`, they are double-tested with built-in `math.degrees` and
`math.radians` respectively.

## Question 4

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

Still new to Python, I required a full day to complete the assignment. Much of
them are spent learning [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
(`sys`, `unittest`) and code styling (`pylint`, [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).

## Question 5

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

My online resources are mostly composed of StackOverflow and official Python
documentation. Increasingly, GitHub is helpful to me to learn code style and
conventions from popular open-source projects.

## Question 6

> How did you resolve the issues when you encountered obstacles to completing
  your program? Did you use Google or other resources to get help? Describe how
  Google or other resources was abled or not able to assist you.

When experiencing an issue in programming, online resources (Google, GitHub,
etc.) are extremely valuable as they often expose insights previously
inaccessible to me. In some cases where I am unable to resolve it myself, I will
open a ticket inviting others to solve my specific problem.

## Question 7

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

In this assignment, I learned that like Bash script, Python supports ANSI
characters for text formatting. But most importantly, I learned about union
type, which dictates that a type is one of several declared types. This
functionality is unheard of to me, it opens up a new possibility when writing
functions.

## Question 8

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?

Nothing to report for now.
