    "> In Python, sub-programs are called **functions**. Each function in a program should do one and only one subtask. Data get passed back and forth between the \"main\" section of the program and various functions. The main part may pass data to a function, receive new data from a function, or both. Data received from a function could in turn be passed on to another function. You can imagine data flowing along the connecting lines in the structure chart. Thatâ€™s how we \"empower these subprograms to work together.\"\n",
