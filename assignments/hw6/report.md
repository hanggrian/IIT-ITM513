# Learning Report

## Question 1

> Did you complete your assignment and did your program run without errors?

I have finished the homework, and my program ran as intended with no error.

## Question 2

> Did your program produce the correct result?

My solution produced the result I expected. However, it could still be imperfect
if my understanding of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is
flawed.

## Question 3

> Did you test your program thoroughly?

I tested my program with randomly generated data multiple times. I am confident
the test was conducted thoroughly.

## Question 4

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

It took approximately four hours to write the code and another two hours for
this report, resulting in almost a full day of work.

## Question 5

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I work alone in creating the program.

## Question 6

> When you encountered obstacles to completing your program, how did you resolve
  the issues? Did you use Google or other resources to get help? Describe how
  Google or other resources was abled or not able to assist you?

I did not encounter a substantial issue in this assignment, mainly because
string operations and regular expression are considerably similar across all
programming languages. However, online resources are still valuable as a
knowledge base to master a concept like LDAP before I start writing my solution.

## Question 7

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

Besides LDAP, of which I had no prior knowledge or experience, I learned
multiple string commands by attaching a prefix character such as format
`f'...'`, raw `r'...'`, Unicode `u'...'` and byte `b'...'`.

## Question 8

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?

I enjoy how third-party libraries (or packages) are imported into Python
scripts. Since they are installed system-wide, they do not impact the overall
file size of the program. This is a direct contrast to compiled programming
languages like Java and C, where libraries will expand their respective `.jar`
and `.o` file sizes. Because of this reason, I am less cautious in importing
other people's work in Python.
