    "# [Homework 4](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-ITM513/blob/assets/assignments/hw4.pdf): Graphs with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "> A picture is worth a thousand words, and with Python's matplotlib library, fortunately, takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic. Matplotlib is the brainchild of John Hunter (1968-2012), who, along with its many contributors, have put an immeasurable amount of time and effort into producing a piece of software utilized by thousands of scientists worldwide. Learning matplotlib can be a frustrating process at times. The problem is not that matplotlib's documentation is lacking: the documentation is actually extensive.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using the library Matplotlib and the provided data files create the following graphs. Your program should open and read the given data files and carefully collect the data and plot the graphs.\n",
