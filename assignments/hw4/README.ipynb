    "# [Homework 4](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-ITM513/blob/assets/assignments/hw4.pdf): Graphs with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "> A picture is worth a thousand words, and with Python's matplotlib library, fortunately, takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic. Matplotlib is the brainchild of John Hunter (1968-2012), who, along with its many contributors, have put an immeasurable amount of time and effort into producing a piece of software utilized by thousands of scientists worldwide. Learning matplotlib can be a frustrating process at times. The problem is not that matplotlib's documentation is lacking: the documentation is actually extensive.\n",

    "> Using the library Matplotlib and the provided data files create the following graphs. Your program should open and read the given data files and carefully collect the data and plot the graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "I spent roughly 4 hours studying [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [price-parser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/price-parser), and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to complete the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **5.** Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?\n",

    "> **7.** What did you learn from doing this assignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from gaining knowledge of matplotlib, I learned that like JavaScript, Python's map data structure (or dictionary) is essentially a JSON object. I also learn about more types such as `Callable`, `Any`, etc.\n",

Although I do enjoy the benefit of simple package management that is integrated directly into the Terminal, I have to say I disagree with their approach of including almost everything in the installation. This includes a code editor (*VSCode*), full-blown IDEs (*DataSpell* & *Spyder*), and GUI development kit (*Qt Console*), resulting in a whooping file size of **8GB**. In comparison, below are the file sizes of several popular SDKs and package managers.\n",
