# Learning Report

## Question 1

> Did you complete your assignment and did your program run without errors?

My assignment is complete without error.

## Question 2

> Did your program produce the correct result?

My programs produced the same results as the expected images in the question
sheet.

## Question 3

> Did you test your program thoroughly?

Yes, I tested my program using the given text files.

## Question 4

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

I spent roughly 4 hours studying [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
[price-parser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/price-parser) and [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
to complete the assignment.

## Question 5

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I wrote the solutions myself mostly using the well-documented [examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
provided officially by the Matplotlib team.

## Question 6

> How did you resolve the issues when you encountered obstacles to completing
  your program? Did you use Google or other resources to get help? Describe how
  Google or other resources was abled or not able to assist you.

There was a moment when it felt like reading online resources was reaching its
limit. I ended up making multiple flawed solutions just to see which one works.
It's a personal reminder that sometimes brute force does work.

## Question 7

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

Aside from gaining knowledge of Matplotlib, I learned that like JavaScript,
Python's map data structure (or dictionary) is essentially a JSON object. I also
learn about more types such as `Callable`, `Any`, etc.

## Question 8

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?

I would like to express my observation of Anaconda distribution. Although I do
enjoy the benefit of simple package management that is integrated directly into
the Terminal, I have to say I disagree with their approach of including almost
everything in the installation. This includes a code editor (*VSCode*),
full-blown IDEs (*DataSpell* & *Spyder*), and GUI development tool
(*Qt Console*), resulting in a whooping file size of **8GB**. In comparison,
below are the file sizes of several popular SDKs and package managers.

| Name | File Size |
| --- | --- |
| **Python** | 50MB |
| Java Development Kit | 200MB (standard)<br>300MB (with JavaFX) |
| Android SDK | 1GB (standard)<br>2GB (with system image & build tool) |
| Unity | 2GB |
| Node Package Manager | 50MB |
| Homebrew for *macOS* | 1GB |

Personally, it is difficult for me to justify the large file size over a
standard Python installation with the default PIP package manager.
