# Learning Report

## Question 1

> Did you complete your assignment and did it run without errors?

I have completed all the functionalities required to complete this assignment.
The program ran without errors.

## Question 2

> Did your program produce the correct result?

The solution I wrote behaves as expected. It produces a comparable result as
examples in the question sheet.

## Question 3

> Did you test your program thoroughly?

I tested my program with multiple entries of sample data. Although there are
still edge cases to consider, the tests are thorough.

## Question 4

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

Completing this assignment took me several days. I apologize for the delay, the
first week after a long break is always difficult.

## Question 5

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I took the responsibility of writing the program by myself.

## Question 6

> When you encountered obstacles to completing your program, how did you resolve
  the issues? Did you use Google to get help? Describe how Google was able or
  not able to assist you?

When I encounter an issue during development, I will gather as much information
about the obstacle and its circumstances so that Google can better understand my
prompt. However, when unfamiliar with new technology, I find it more impactful
to begin with official resources rather than online forums.

## Question 7

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

In this assignment, I learned how to serialize objects into binary files for
caching purposes, powered by the Pickle library. On the other hand, lists and
sets are somewhat covered in previous homework.

## Question 8

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?

Nothing to report for now. Wishing everyone had a nice Spring Break!
