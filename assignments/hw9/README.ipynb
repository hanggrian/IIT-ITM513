    "> Making sure that your company records are maintained and stored properly is a project that could be the most important day-to-day work for your business. Developing and maintaining a complete records management program will have a sizeable impact on your company. With the right program in place, your company will have a roadmap that tracks and files all your records leading to a more efficient work environment.\n",

    "> You are required to write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs. The program should display a menu that lets the user lookup a personâ€™s email address, add a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address. The program should *bind* the dictionary and save it to a file when the user exits the program. Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the dictionary from the file and unbind it. The program should run continuously until the user selects an option to exit from the menu.\r",
