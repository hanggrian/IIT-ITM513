# Big data essay

Big data can be categorized as data that are larger than conventional databases.
The size is the main differentiator because big data deals with structured,
unstructured and semi-structured data. Big data is extensively studied in data
analytics to identify patterns and extract valuable insights.

## Importance of big data

Big data offers a significant advantage for businesses to stay competitive in
their respective market (Red Hat, 2019). When data can be effectively analyzed,
predictions derived from big data can help organizations make informed
judgments. These data-driven decisions will ultimately drive them to improve
daily operations, develop new products and satisfy customer needs.

## Types of big data

Before the revelation of big data analytics, information is historically stored
in traditional structural databases (MongoDB, n.d.). However, recent advances
have shifted the trend into unstructured data with approximately 80% to 90% of
the adoption rate in 2023. The shift highlights the importance of understanding
different data types of big data.

1.  **Structured data:** Consists of text and digit characters arranged into
    cells, rows and columns similar to a spreadsheet document. The
    pre-determined format of structured data makes it easier for computers to
    parse the information.
1.  **Semi-structured data:** Unlike strict restrictions, semi-structured data
    uses tags and a hierarchical structure to organize information. One of their
    key aspects is having a flexible schema, allowing variations within the same
    dataset.
1.  **Unstructured data:** Unstructured data lacks a unified structure or
    categorization, like image, video and audio files. Their modern application
    involves natural language processing for advanced machine-learning tasks.

## Three V's of big data

Gartner first introduced the concept of the three V's of big data in 2001
(Google, n.d.).

1.  **Volume:** The sheer amount of information and continuous transfer between
    devices.
1.  **Velocity:** The speed at which data is generated and processed, hopefully
    nearing real-time capability.
1.  **Variety:** Supports various file formats from diverse sources, even those
    without a fixed schema.

Additionally, three more V's are frequently suggested to complement the original
ones.

4.  **Veracity:** The quality and accuracy of data, which may degrade from
    errors and inconsistencies.
4.  **Variability:** The interpretation of data can evolve, and so should their
    collection technique.
4.  **Value:** The potential gain of processing gathered information, which is
    data analytics' primary goal.
