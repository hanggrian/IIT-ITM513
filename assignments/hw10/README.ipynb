    "# [Homework 10](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-ITM513/blob/assets/assignments/hw10.pdf): Data visualization using Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "> Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. The questions below enforce you to explore the power of Python seaborn library package. It is quite challenging to memorize all function parameters when applying seaborn package in your program. There are various approaches to generate data visualization. Use existing documents, example programs, or other resources that can be located on the cloud to assist you in understanding on how to implement seaborn.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Note** â€“ This assignment is quite challenging and interesting as well. The activity requires that you do some trial and error method to achieve your goals. The *Seaborn* module has various gadgets you can use with proper syntax to get the appropriate outcome. Be persistent! It is not advisable to try to complete this assignment in the eleventh hour. Start early."
