# Learning Report

## Summary

Upon starting the first part of the assignment, I glanced at the [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html)
and [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html)
documentation. I finally understand that DataFrame is the return value of
`read_csv` while a Series is a child element within a DataFrame parent. And
since Series and DataFrame are an array-like object, we can index an element
just like we would on a Numpy array, as we practiced in previous homework.

With this basic understanding of how Pandas components work with each other, I
can solve the second part regarding the analysis of Titanic passengers. What
strikes me the most about the DataFrame `get` value is that it is flexible,
accepting both column name and search predicate as input value.

## Question 1

> Did you successfully get your assignment done? Did it run? Any error? Did you
  get the correct result? Did you test your program thoroughly?

My solution produces an identical output as shown in the question sheet, leading
me to believe they are correct.

## Question 2

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

Having just returned to Chicago, I can finally dedicate more time to homework.
Completing this one took me less than a day.

## Question 3

> Did you find the assignment easy or challenging for you?

This assignment is easier because it marks the second time we have used the
Pandas library.

## Question 4

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I wrote the solution myself using the official [Pandas user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html).

## Question 5

> When you encountered obstacles to completing your program, how did you resolve
  the issues? Did you use Google to get help? Describe how Google was able or
  not able to assist you?

Although I did encounter errors during the assignment, they were resolvable with
a few trials and errors. The user guide is sufficient as a single guide for this
assignment.

## Question 6

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

I learned how to use bitwise and operator, a functionality extensively used in
the Pandas library.

## Question 7

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor? Make sure
  you provide program output on each option.

I have no further information to share, wishing everyone a good mid-term.
