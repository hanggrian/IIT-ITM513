# Learning Report

## Question 1

> Did you complete your assignment and did your program run without errors?

I finished the assignment and the final program ran without errors.

## Question 2

> Did your program produce the correct result?

I believe so. This was not immediately clear because Problem 1 expects `73.6902`
as the correct output while my program produced `72.6902`. However, I am certain
that the solution is correct after confirming the result with
[Regular Polygon Calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/polygon.php).

## Question 3

> Did you test your program thoroughly?

Yes, the unit test files are included in the tests directory.

## Question 4

> How much time did you spend completing your assignment?

Being new to Python programming, I spent an entire day learning about control
flows, code conventions, and other official documentation before completing the
assignment at the end of the day.

## Question 5

> Did you write the program yourself? Did you get any help from anyone?

I wrote the program myself with the help of online resources such as
[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

## Question 6

> How did you resolve the issues when you encountered obstacles to completing
  your program? Did you use Google or other resources to get help? Describe how
  Google or other resources was abled or not able to assist you.

When experiencing an issue in programming, online resources (Google, GitHub,
etc.) are extremely valuable as they often expose insights previously
inaccessible to me. In some cases where I am unable to resolve it myself, I will
open a ticket inviting others to solve my specific problem.

## Question 7

> What did you learn from doing this assignment?

The most valuable lesson for me is learning how to use Jupyter Notebook, as
recommended by the Python community. I learned that Jupyter is a more powerful
notation tool than Markdown and should be the standard when developing Python
projects.

## Question 8

> Any other information you would like to share with your instructor?

I would like to thank you for sharing all assignments ahead of time. This lets
me see more code samples and also forces me to use Jupyter Notebook early.
